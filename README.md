# Snakes & Ladders with Dynamic Programming
***

This project is a recreation of the popular game Snakes and Ladders, implemented using dynamic programming in the Java 
programming language. The game features additional elements, such as apples that can increase or decrease player points,
to add an extra level of complexity to the game.

The game is organized using a clear and structured approach, with each aspect of the game having its own class. This 
makes the implementation easy to understand, modify, and maintain. Furthermore, this implementation includes two 
computer-controlled players. The first is a HeuristicPlayer that can intelligently choose which die to roll to maximize
its points. The second is a MinMaxPlayer that utilizes the MinMax algorithm and nodes to choose the best move, while 
considering the two next moves of its opponent.

Details about the implementation can be found in the [report](snakes_ladders_ds_report.pdf) file. This project was
created as part of a team project for the "Data Structures" course.
